Topaz ActiveX Control SigPlus ABAP implementation
Device Model: T-LBK57GC-BHSB-R
This development triggers a Topaz Sigplus Signature Pad. The device displays delivery items from an SAP system. Allows a user to accept or cancel the order. If accepted, the user is taken to additional screens that require a signature at the end of the sequence. Once the signature has been successfully captured. The signature is then stored in SAP (BDS) as a text object and a header text value is also created in the Delivery Document.
